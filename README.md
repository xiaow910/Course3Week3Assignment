This is the project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course  

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

What I did: 


# Load activity labels + features
# Extract only the data on mean and standard deviation
# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
# creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
